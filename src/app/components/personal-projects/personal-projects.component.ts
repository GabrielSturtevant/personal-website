Once a call is received, the program will parse the received text and determine whether a command was issued. If a command was issued, the program would query an SQLite database that would be stored local relative to the server control layer.'

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a working understanding of the concepts of hash-tables, priority queues, and the A* path finding algorithm within a set of constraints provided by the teacher.',
      'Once the program is run, the user must select two points, the program will then visually display the A* path finding process starting from the first selected point until the second selected point is encountered. Once this occurs, the "player" will begin to move from the first point along the selected path until it either finds a map (purple indicators) to treasure (yellow indicators), at which point it will stop it\'s current path, recalculate a path to the treasure that the map leads to and will continue, disregarding additional maps it passes, until the treasure is found. Upon finding the treasure, a new path will be calculated from the current position to the originally selected final position, where the process will repeat itself until the final destination is reached.'
